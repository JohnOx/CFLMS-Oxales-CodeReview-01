# CFLMS-Oxales-CodeReview-01

Very first website project at CodeFactory Vienna! 

Project description:

You will create a new homepage for your blog!

- Correct usage of the HTML structure (proper order of HTML elements)

- Correct usage of <img> to present images on the web page

- Correct usage of lists to show the menu (navigation bar)

- Correct placement of images (layout as presented) with their consequent titles

- Correct position of the company logo and accompanying text (“Your Name - Future Full Stack Web Developer“)

- Correct code structure (aka code indentation) that makes it easier for humans to read.  

- Use CSS selectors (classes and/or IDs) to style your web page ( the colors, font size, font style etc.).

Bonus:

- Your page style is using the width properly to be a bit responsive (it looks fine in different web browser sizes)

- Add links to the menu that lead to other local HTML pages that you will additionally create for these bonus points and you are free to provide your design/layout solutions for these additional pages.
